# API Overview

The Recovery Hub API is designed to provide developers with robust tools and endpoints for managing account recovery processes on the Stellar network. This API is essential for applications that require secure, decentralized recovery mechanisms, allowing users to regain control of their Stellar accounts in the event of lost credentials.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Recovery Hub API is to facilitate secure interactions between users, recovery servers, and the Stellar network. It ensures that users can recover their accounts by utilizing a network of trusted servers, while developers can easily integrate these functionalities into their applications.

## Key Features

1. **Account Recovery:** 
   - The API allows users to initiate and manage account recovery processes by adding or removing recovery servers as signers to their Stellar accounts.

2. **Multi-Signer Verification:**
   - The API provides endpoints for verifying that multiple recovery servers have signed a transaction, ensuring a secure recovery process.

3. **Secure Authentication:**
   - Authentication mechanisms are built into the API, allowing for secure and verified interactions between users and recovery servers.

4. **Server Management:**
   - Developers can use the API to manage recovery servers, check their availability, and authenticate them for use in recovery processes.

5. **Flexible Integration:**
   - The API is designed with flexibility in mind, allowing developers to integrate it into a wide range of applications, from simple account recovery flows to more complex multi-signature transactions.

6. **Rate Limiting:**
   - To ensure fair usage and prevent abuse, the API includes rate limiting on various endpoints, with clear guidance on handling rate limit errors.

7. **Detailed Error Handling:**
   - The API provides comprehensive error codes and descriptions, enabling developers to handle issues efficiently and provide clear feedback to users.

8. **Developer-Friendly Documentation:**
   - The API is well-documented, with detailed descriptions of each endpoint, usage examples, and guidance on integrating the API into your application.

## Use Cases

- **Decentralized Wallets:** Integrate the API to provide users with secure account recovery options.
- **Multi-Signature Services:** Utilize the API to manage multi-signer setups for enhanced account security.
- **Stellar-Based Applications:** Implement recovery features that ensure users can regain access to their accounts if they lose their private keys.

This API is a critical tool for developers building on the Stellar network, offering the necessary functionality to enhance user security and trust through reliable account recovery processes.

# Recovery Hub API Overview

## Purpose
The Recovery Hub API is designed to facilitate secure and reliable account recovery for Stellar-based applications. It allows developers to integrate recovery services into their apps, enabling users to recover access to their Stellar accounts in case they lose their private keys. The API provides endpoints for managing recovery servers, initiating recovery processes, and verifying account ownership through a distributed network of trusted servers.

## Key Features

### Distributed Recovery System
The API leverages a network of distributed recovery servers to provide a decentralized and secure method for account recovery. Each server in the network plays a crucial role in verifying user identities and signing recovery transactions.

### Secure Authentication and Verification
The API includes robust authentication and verification mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can initiate and complete the recovery process. This includes support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and the use of JWT tokens for secure communication.

### Flexible Account Linking and Management
Users can link multiple recovery servers to their accounts, providing flexibility and redundancy in the recovery process. The API allows for easy management of these links, including adding and removing servers as needed.

### Transaction Signing and Execution
The API facilitates the creation, signing, and execution of Stellar transactions as part of the recovery process. This ensures that the recovery process is smooth and that users can regain access to their accounts without unnecessary delays.

## Example Usage
The Recovery Hub API can be used in a variety of scenarios, including:

- **Account Recovery**: Allow users to recover access to their Stellar accounts in case of lost private keys.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhance security by requiring multiple recovery servers to verify a user's identity before granting access.
- **Secure Transaction Signing**: Ensure that recovery transactions are signed by trusted servers before being submitted to the Stellar network.

### Example cURL Request

To interact with the Recovery Hub API, developers must include the appropriate authentication headers in their requests. Here’s an example of how to retrieve the status of recovery servers:

```
curl -X GET https://api.recoveryhub.com/v1/servers/status \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

This request retrieves the current status of all recovery servers, which can be used to monitor the health of the recovery network.
