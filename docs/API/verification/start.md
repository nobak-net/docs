# `/v1/verify`

## Purpose
The `/v1/verify` endpoint is used to initiate the verification process for an authentication method associated with an account within the Recovery Hub system. This can include verifying an email address, phone number, or other authentication methods that require confirmation.

## HTTP Method
**POST**

## URL
`/v1/verify`

## Headers
- `Authorization`: Required. The API key must be included in the header to authenticate the request. Example: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`.
- `Content-Type`: Required. Set to `application/json`.

## Parameters
The following parameters should be included in the JSON body of the request:

- **type**: Required. The type of authentication method being verified (e.g., `email`, `phone`, etc.).
- **value**: Required. The value of the authentication method (e.g., the actual email address or phone number).

### Example Request Body

```
{
  "type": "email",
  "value": "user@example.com"
}
```

## Example Request

To initiate the verification of an email address:

```
curl -X POST https://api.recoveryhub.com/v1/verify \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "type": "email",
  "value": "user@example.com"
}'
```

## Response Structure
The response will be a JSON object indicating the success or failure of the verification initiation process.

### Response Fields

- **status**: The status of the verification request (e.g., `success` or `failed`).
- **message**: A message providing additional details about the status of the request.
- **verification_id**: The unique identifier for the verification process (only present if the request was successful).

### Example Response (Successful Initiation)

```
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Verification initiated successfully.",
}
```

### Example Response (Failed Initiation)

```
{
  "status": "failed",
  "message": "Failed to initiate verification. The email address may be invalid or already verified."
}
```

## Example Usage

Here's an example of how to call this endpoint using `curl`:

```
curl -X POST https://api.recoveryhub.com/v1/verify \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "type": "email",
  "value": "user@example.com"
}'
```

This request will initiate the verification process for the specified email address, triggering the sending of a verification link or code to the user's email.

## Best Practices
- Ensure that the `value` provided is correct and belongs to the user before initiating the verification process.
- Consider implementing rate limiting on this endpoint to prevent abuse, such as spamming verification emails or SMS.
- Handle potential errors gracefully, such as when a user attempts to verify an already verified method.
