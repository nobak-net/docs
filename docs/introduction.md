Welcome to the **Recovery Hub API Documentation**. This documentation is designed to help developers integrate and interact with the Recovery Hub platform effectively. The Recovery Hub API provides a set of tools to manage accounts, authenticate users, and interact with recovery servers, enabling robust account recovery mechanisms within the Stellar network.

## Key Features

- **Server Status Monitoring:** Keep track of the operational status of recovery servers.
- **Account Management:** Easily create, link, and manage Stellar accounts.
- **Authentication:** Securely authenticate and verify users using various methods, including email and Stellar addresses.
- **Contract Management:** Add or remove server signers to control account access and execute recovery procedures.

### Distributed Recovery System
The API leverages a network of distributed recovery servers to provide a decentralized and secure method for account recovery. Each server in the network plays a crucial role in verifying user identities and signing recovery transactions.

### Secure Authentication and Verification
The API includes robust authentication and verification mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can initiate and complete the recovery process. This includes support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) and the use of JWT tokens for secure communication.

### Flexible Account Linking and Management
Users can link multiple recovery servers to their accounts, providing flexibility and redundancy in the recovery process. The API allows for easy management of these links, including adding and removing servers as needed.

### Transaction Signing and Execution
The API facilitates the creation, signing, and execution of Stellar transactions as part of the recovery process. This ensures that the recovery process is smooth and that users can regain access to their accounts without unnecessary delays.


## Getting Started

To start using the API, you need to authenticate your requests by including your API key in the header of every request. The API is designed to be intuitive and developer-friendly, with clear error messages and comprehensive response structures.
