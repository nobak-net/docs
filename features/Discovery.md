## [Dapp Discovery](https://github.com/nobak-net/metadata)

Nobak's app discovery feature works by utilizing a community-driven approach where anyone can contribute to a repository named [metadata](https://github.com/nobak-net/metadata). Contributors can add their decentralized application (dApp) to this repository. Once added, these apps become discoverable within the Nobak mobile app.

This open-source collaboration enables a diverse range of dApps to be easily accessible to Nobak users, fostering an inclusive and expansive digital ecosystem on the Stellar network. This approach encourages community engagement and ensures that Nobak's app offerings are continually updated and varied.
